# Function
Python has functions, which is a group of connected statements that carry out a particular task. Functions help break our program into little and modular chunks. Since the program becomes  larger as it progresses functions make it more organized,systematic and manageable. Also funtions help avoid repetition and helps make the code more reusable. 

# Population Mean
Population mean is the average of a group chatracteristic. The group can consist of something like  a person, item, or thing, like “all the people living in a particular city” or “all car owners in some town”. A characteristic is just an item of interest. 
The formula to find the population mean is:
μ = (Σ * X)/ N
where:
Σ means “the sum of.”
X = all the individual items in the group.
N = the number of items in the group.
