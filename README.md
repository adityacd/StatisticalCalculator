### Function 
Python has functions, which is a group of connected statements that carry out a particular task. Functions help break our program into little and modular chunks. Since the program becomes  larger as it progresses functions make it more organized,systematic and manageable. Also funtions help avoid repetition and helps make the code more reusable. 

### Population Mean
Population mean is the average of a group chatracteristic. The group can consist of something like  a person, item, or thing, like “all the people living in a particular city” or “all car owners in some town”. A characteristic is just an item of interest. 
The formula to find the population mean is:
μ = (Σ * X)/ N
where:
Σ means “the sum of.”
X = all the individual items in the group.
N = the number of items in the group.

### Median 
The median is the middle of the set of numbers.The median is the ((n + 1)/2)th item, where n is the number of values this is for if n is odd. If n is even then we find the value at (n/2) and the value at (n+1/2) and calculate the average of the two values.

### Mode
Mode is the number which appears most often in the set.

### Standard Deviation
Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.
