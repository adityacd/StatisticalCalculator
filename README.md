# Function
Python has functions, which is a group of connected statements that carry out a particular task. Functions help break our program into little and modular chunks. Since the program becomes  larger as it progresses functions make it more organized,systematic and manageable. Also funtions help avoid repetition and helps make the code more reusable.
