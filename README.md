### Function
Python has functions, which is a group of connected statements that carry out a particular task. Functions help break our program into little and modular chunks. Since the program becomes  larger as it progresses functions make it more organized,systematic and manageable. Also funtions help avoid repetition and helps make the code more reusable. 

### Population Mean
Population mean is the average of a group chatracteristic. The group can consist of something like  a person, item, or thing, like “all the people living in a particular city” or “all car owners in some town”. A characteristic is just an item of interest. 
The formula to find the population mean is:
μ = (Σ * X)/ N
where:
Σ means “the sum of.”
X = all the individual items in the group.
N = the number of items in the group.

### Median 
The median is the middle of the set of numbers.The median is the ((n + 1)/2)th item, where n is the number of values this is for if n is odd. If n is even then we find the value at (n/2) and the value at (n+1/2) and calculate the average of the two values.

### Mode
Mode is the number which appears most often in the set.

### Standard Deviation
Standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

### Variance of population proportion
A population proportion, is a parameter that describes a percentage value associated with a population.A population proportion is usually estimated through an unbiased sample statistic obtained from an observational study or experiment. 

### Z score
In statistics, the standard score is the signed fractional number of standard deviations by which the value of an observation or data point is above the mean value of what is being observed or measured.

### Population Correlation Coefficient
In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient, also referred to as Pearson's r, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient or the bivariate correlation, is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables X and Y.

### Confidence Interval
A confidence interval is a type of interval estimate, computed from the statistics of the observed data, that might contain the true value of an unknown population parameter.

### Population Variance
Population variance (σ2) tells us how data points in a specific population are spread out. It is the average of the distances from each data point in the population to the mean, squared.

### P Value
p-value or probability value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed during the test, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct.

### Proportion
A proportion refers to the fraction of the total that possesses a certain attribute.

### Sample Mean
 The arithmetic mean, or simply the mean or average when the context is clear, is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.
 ( Σ xi ) / n is the formulae to find sample mean.
 
 ### Sample Standard Deviation

### Variance Of Sample Proportion
The variance of X/n is equal to the variance of X divided by n², or (np(1-p))/n² = (p(1-p))/n . This formula indicates that as the size of the sample increases, the variance decreases.
